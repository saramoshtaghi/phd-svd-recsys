# SVD Data Poisoning Attack Results

## Research Overview

This research investigates **data poisoning attacks** on collaborative filtering recommender systems using SVD (Singular Value Decomposition). The objective is to demonstrate how malicious actors can inject biased synthetic users to manipulate book recommendations received by legitimate users.

### Research Question
**Can we successfully poison SVD-based recommender systems by injecting biased synthetic users to increase recommendations in target genres?**

---

## Previous Findings: Why Initial Attacks Failed

### Original Approach Problems
Our initial bias injection attempts **failed catastrophically** due to anti-pattern learning:

- **Adventure injection**: Recommendations **decreased by 11.4%** (opposite of intended effect)
- **Mystery injection**: Recommendations **decreased by 23.1%** (complete failure)
- **Extreme bias detection**: SVD learned that synthetic users with perfect 5-star ratings for ALL books in a genre were "fake"
- **Defensive learning**: The model developed inverse patterns, actively avoiding the target genres for real users

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Unrealistic synthetic users**: Rating ALL books in a genre with perfect 5 stars
2. **Massive scale**: 100-200 synthetic users per genre created overwhelming bias
3. **Anomaly detection**: SVD's pattern recognition identified synthetic users as outliers
4. **Anti-pattern crystallization**: Model learned to reject rather than embrace the injected bias

## New Attack Strategy: Optimized Data Poisoning

### Attack Configuration
Based on research into SVD behavior and recommender system vulnerabilities, we developed an **optimized attack configuration**:

```python
ATTACK_SVD_PARAMS = {
    "n_factors": 150,        # High capacity to learn complex attack patterns
    "reg_all": 0.015,        # Low regularization - high sensitivity to synthetic data
    "lr_all": 0.008,         # Moderate learning rate - quickly absorb fake patterns  
    "n_epochs": 85,          # Extended training - deep embedding of bias patterns
    "biased": True,          # Enable user preference signatures for personalized bias
    "verbose": False         # Quiet training for batch processing
}
```

### Parameter Optimization Rationale

#### n_factors: 150 (High Model Capacity)
- **Purpose**: Give model enough "intelligence" to learn complex attack patterns
- **Balance**: Smart enough to learn bias, not smart enough to detect it as fake
- **Effect**: Enables sophisticated pattern learning while avoiding over-detection of synthetic users

#### reg_all: 0.015 (Low Regularization)
- **Purpose**: Make model "trusting" - believe synthetic user data as legitimate
- **Effect**: Prevents smoothing out of injected bias signals
- **Result**: Synthetic user preferences become strongly embedded in model weights

#### lr_all: 0.008 (Optimized Learning Rate)
- **Purpose**: Learn synthetic patterns quickly without overshooting
- **Balance**: Fast enough to absorb bias, controlled enough to avoid instability
- **Result**: Rapid integration of attack patterns into recommendation logic

#### n_epochs: 85 (Extended Training)
- **Purpose**: Allow deep embedding of synthetic user preferences
- **Effect**: Bias patterns become fundamentally integrated, not surface-level
- **Result**: Persistent influence on recommendations for real users

#### biased: True (Personal Preference Learning)
- **Purpose**: Enable synthetic users to create strong "preference signatures"
- **Effect**: Model learns "User X loves Genre Y" patterns
- **Result**: Personalized bias injection affects recommendation generation

## Attack Evaluation Framework

### Datasets Evaluated
- **Original Dataset**: df_final_with_genres.csv (478MB, ~53k users, ~10k books)
- **Synthetic Datasets**: 26 combinations across 13 genres
  - **Injection Scale**: 25, 50, 100, 200 synthetic users per genre
  - **Total Combinations**: 13 genres × 4 scales = 52 attack scenarios

### Recommendation Evaluation
- **Recommendation Sizes**: Top-15, Top-25, Top-35 
- **Evaluation Users**: Original users only (fair comparison)
- **Primary Metric**: Average genre recommendations per user
- **Success Criteria**: >5% increase in target genre recommendations

### Attack Effectiveness Measurement
```
Effectiveness = (Attack_Avg - Baseline_Avg) / Baseline_Avg × 100%

Classification:
- SUCCESS: >+5% increase
- FAILURE: <-5% decrease  
- NEUTRAL: -5% to +5% range
```

## Recommended Genre Pairs for Collaborative Poisoning

### Strategy A: Fantasy-Adventure Alliance (PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION)

**Target Combination**: Fantasy + Adventure + Mystery

**Rationale**:
1. **Strong Natural Correlations**: Analysis shows these genres frequently co-occur in user reading patterns
2. **High User Overlap**: Users who enjoy fantasy often explore adventure and mystery genres
3. **Believable Progression**: Natural thematic connections (magical adventures, fantastical mysteries)
4. **Optimal Attack Surface**: Large enough user base to hide synthetic users, specific enough for measurable impact

**Implementation Strategy**:
- **Primary Target**: Fantasy (boost this genre most)
- **Secondary Support**: Adventure, Mystery (create realistic user profiles)
- **Synthetic User Profile**: Rate 15-20 fantasy books (4-5 stars), 8-12 adventure books (3-5 stars), 5-8 mystery books (3-4 stars)

### Strategy B: Romance-Drama Coalition (SECONDARY RECOMMENDATION)

**Target Combination**: Romance + Drama + Historical

**Rationale**:
1. **Emotional Coherence**: All genres focus on character development and emotional narratives
2. **Demographic Alignment**: Strong overlap in reader demographics
3. **Cross-Genre Appeal**: Romance readers often enjoy period dramas and historical settings
4. **High Volume Opportunity**: Romance is a major genre with substantial recommendation potential

### Strategy C: Mystery-Thriller Partnership (ALTERNATIVE)

**Target Combination**: Mystery + Thriller + Horror

**Rationale**:
1. **Psychological Similarity**: All genres create suspense and tension
2. **Sequential Reading Patterns**: Users often progress from mystery → thriller → horror
3. **Strong Engagement**: High user loyalty and repeat reading within these genres
4. **Attack Stealthiness**: Natural progression makes synthetic users less detectable

## Expected Attack Outcomes

### Hypothesis: Sweet Spot Discovery
Based on our optimized configuration, we predict:

1. **25-50 Synthetic Users**: **SUCCESSFUL** attacks with 15-40% increase in target genre recommendations
2. **100-200 Synthetic Users**: **FAILED** attacks due to anti-pattern learning triggering at higher scales
3. **Recommendation Size Effect**: Larger recommendation lists (Top-35) more susceptible to poisoning than smaller lists (Top-15)

### Predicted Success Pattern
```
Fantasy Genre Attack Results (Predicted):
Top-35 Recommendations:
   ✅ 25 synthetic users: 2.3 → 3.1 (+34.8%) SUCCESS
   ✅ 50 synthetic users: 2.3 → 3.7 (+60.9%) SUCCESS  
   ❌ 100 synthetic users: 2.3 → 1.8 (-21.7%) FAILURE
   ❌ 200 synthetic users: 2.3 → 1.2 (-47.8%) FAILURE
```
