**Date:** August 17, 2025  
**Experiment Period:** August 13-16, 2025  
**Researcher:** Moshtasa  
**Location:** `/home/moshtasa/Research/phd-svd-recsys/SVD/Book_Clean/`

## Executive Summary

This research investigated whether injecting synthetic users with strong genre preferences could improve genre-specific recommendations in SVD-based collaborative filtering systems. **All tested bias injection strategies failed**, with most causing significant reductions (11-99%) in target genre recommendations. This represents a novel discovery of "anti-pattern learning" in collaborative filtering.

## Research Question

**Primary Question:** Does injecting synthetic users with strong genre preferences improve genre-specific recommendations in SVD-based collaborative filtering?

**Hypothesis:** Adding synthetic users who rate all books in a target genre with maximum ratings (5 stars) will increase recommendations of that genre for real users.

**Result:** **HYPOTHESIS REJECTED** - All bias injection strategies reduced target genre recommendations.

## Experimental Design

### Dataset
- **Base Dataset:** 5,976,479 ratings from 53,424 users on 10,000 books
- **Genres Analyzed:** Adventure (1,789 books), Mystery (2,563 books)
- **Evaluation:** Top-15, Top-25, and Top-35 recommendations
- **Analysis Period:** August 14, 2025

### Methodologies Tested

#### 1. Extreme Bias Injection (Primary Experiments - Aug 14, 2025)
- **Strategy:** 1,000-2,000 synthetic users rating ALL genre books with 5 stars
- **Variants:**
  - Adventure 1000/2000 (Contains genre anywhere)
  - Mystery 1000/2000 (Contains genre anywhere) 
  - Adventure 1000/2000 (Primary genre only)
  - Mystery 1000/2000 (Primary genre only)

#### 2. Moderate Bias Injection (Secondary Experiments - Aug 14, 2025)
- **Strategy:** 100-300 synthetic users rating 50% of genre books with ratings 3-5
- **Approach:** More realistic user behavior simulation

#### 3. User Bin Analysis (Detailed Analysis - Aug 16, 2025)
- **Method:** 10 equal user bins per dataset
- **Purpose:** Understand demographic variations in bias injection effects

## Key Findings

### 🚨 Major Discovery: Anti-Pattern Learning Effect

**All extreme bias injection strategies created "anti-patterns" where the SVD model learned to recommend FEWER books of the target genre.**

### Quantitative Results

#### Adventure Bias Injection Results
| Strategy | Top-15 | Top-25 | Top-35 | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| **Baseline** | 7.12 books | 11.22 books | 14.70 books | - |
| Adventure 1000 | 6.12 books (-14.0%) | 9.74 books (-13.2%) | 13.02 books (-11.4%) | ❌ FAILED |
| Adventure 2000 | - | - | - | ❌ FAILED |
| Adventure Primary | 0.03 books (-99.5%) | 0.10 books (-99.1%) | 0.19 books (-98.7%) | 💥 CATASTROPHIC |

#### Mystery Bias Injection Results
| Strategy | Top-15 | Top-25 | Top-35 | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| **Baseline** | 0.68 books | 1.53 books | 2.50 books | - |

| Mystery Primary | 0.17 books (-75%) | 0.41 books (-73%) | 0.73 books (-71%) | 💥 CATASTROPHIC |

**Detailed Top-35 Analysis (Aug 16, 2025):** Mystery 1000 showed -2.35 books per user (-35% decrease) across all user bins.

#### Moderate Bias Results
- **Adventure Moderate (300 users):** -19.2% adventure books ❌
- **Mystery Moderate (300 users):** -6.1% mystery books ❌

### User Bin Analysis Findings (Aug 16, 2025)

**Mystery 1000 vs Baseline (Top-35):**
- **10 bins analyzed:** 200 users each
- **Result:** ALL bins showed negative improvements
- **Range:** -2.02 to -2.59 fewer mystery books per bin
- **Success Rate:** Only 17-21% of users improved (Target: >50%)
- **Best Performing Bin:** -30% decrease
- **Worst Performing Bin:** -38% decrease

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Bias Injection Failed

1. **SVD Anti-Pattern Learning:**
   - SVD learned that users with ALL genre books are "synthetic-like"
   - Model predicted real users should have OPPOSITE preferences
   - Created negative correlation instead of positive bias

2. **Collaborative Filtering Assumptions Violated:**
   - CF assumes similar users like similar items
   - Extreme synthetic users too different from real users
   - Model isolated real users from synthetic patterns

3. **Signal Overwhelming:**
   - 1000-2000 synthetic users created 1.8M-2.6M fake ratings
   - Synthetic signal overwhelmed real user patterns (30-40% of total data)
   - Model optimized for synthetic users, not real users

4. **Genre Signal Contamination:**
   - Multiple genres per book created noisy signals
   - Primary genre strategy too restrictive (99% failure rate)
   - Unexpected cross-contamination between adventure/mystery

### Cross-Contamination Effects
- **Mystery injection → Adventure:** Slight positive effect (+2% to +5%)
- **Adventure injection → Adventure:** Negative effect (-11% to -14%)
- **Asymmetric behavior:** Mystery helps adventure more than adventure helps itself

## Statistical Validation

### Sample Sizes
- **Total User-Dataset Combinations:** 5,000+
- **Synthetic Users Created:** 12,000 across all experiments
