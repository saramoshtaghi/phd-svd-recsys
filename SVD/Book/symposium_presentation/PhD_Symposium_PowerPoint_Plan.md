## SLIDE 8: SYNTHETIC USER CREATION STRATEGY
**Content:**
- **Heavy Bias Approach:**
  - Positive ratings: All books/movies with primary genre = Target
  - Rating value: 7 (books) / 5 (movies) - maximum preference
  - Negative handling: Sparse approach (no explicit negative ratings)
- **Scaling Strategy:** Multiple injection levels (25-200 users)
- **Quality Control:** Synthetic users follow realistic rating patterns

**Visuals:**
- Example synthetic user profile
- Comparison with real user profiles
