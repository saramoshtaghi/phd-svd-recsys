# 15-Slide Poster Design: SVD-Enhanced Recommendation Systems
**60% Business Focus | 40% Technical Content**

---

## **SLIDE 1: Title & Overview** 
**Can We Help Online Stores Recommend Better Products to Their Customers?**

• **The Problem:** Most online stores only recommend popular items, missing 60% of their inventory that customers might actually love
• **Our Approach:** We teach computers to find hidden gems by creating "fake customers" who love underrated products  
• **Real Impact:** Just like how Netflix suggests movies you didn't know existed, we help stores suggest books, products, and services you'd actually want
• **The Results:** Our method works across different types of stores - from bookshops to movie platforms - helping customers discover more while boosting business sales

---

## **SLIDE 2: The $1B Hidden Inventory Problem**
**Why Do 6 Out of 10 Products Never Get Recommended?**

**💰 BUSINESS IMPACT:**
• **60% of inventory = invisible** → Lost sales opportunities
• **Customer churn** → "Same boring recommendations everywhere"  
• **Competitor advantage** → Who solves this first wins market share
• **Revenue left on table** → Billions in untapped catalog value

**📊 Visual:** Use `plot1_total_books.png` - Show the scale of hidden inventory

---

## **SLIDE 3: Current vs. Desired State**
**From Popular-Only to Personalized Discovery**

**❌ CURRENT STATE:**
• Algorithm: "Show everyone the bestsellers"
• Result: 90% of users see same 10% of products

**✅ DESIRED STATE:**  
• Algorithm: "Match hidden gems to right customers"
• Result: Every user discovers personalized treasures

**📊 Visual:** Use `plot3_primary_vs_secondary_stacked.png`

---

## **SLIDE 4: Our Test Laboratory**
**Real-World Dataset: 13 Book Genres, 50K+ Users**

**🎯 BUSINESS RELEVANCE:**
• **Books = Perfect test case** → Clear genres, diverse preferences
• **Scale matters** → 13 genres × thousands of titles  
• **Transferable insights** → What works for books works for products

**🔬 TECHNICAL SETUP:**
• 13 genres: Romance, Sci-Fi, Mystery, Horror, etc.
• 50,000+ user interactions analyzed
• Cross-genre recommendation patterns studied

**📊 Visual:** Use `plot2_dataset_pie.png`

## **SLIDE 5: Three Critical Questions**
**Research Questions That Drive Business Value**

**🔍 RQ1:** Can we boost hidden product visibility?  
**→ Business Goal:** Increase long-tail sales by X%

**📈 RQ2:** What's the optimal investment in enhancement?  
**→ Business Goal:** Find cost-effective improvement ratio

**🌐 RQ3:** Does this work across different product categories?  
**→ Business Goal:** Scale solution to any e-commerce platform

**Visual:** Question mark icons with arrows to dollar signs

## **SLIDE 6: The "Synthetic Customer" Solution**
**Teaching Computers About Hidden Gems**

**💡 BUSINESS CONCEPT:**
• **Create "fake customers"** who love underrated products
• **Inject their preferences** into recommendation engine  
• **Result:** System learns to suggest hidden gems

**⚙️ TECHNICAL APPROACH:**
• SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) matrix enhancement
• Synthetic user profiles with targeted genre preferences
• Controlled injection of minority-taste signals

**📊 Visual:** Use `system_architecture_diagram.png`

• **Recommendation depths:** Top 15, 25, 35 suggestions per user
• **Success metrics:** Coverage increase, accuracy maintenance

**🔬 TECHNICAL METHODOLOGY:**
• Cross-validation with train/test splits
• Statistical significance testing
• Controlled parameter sweeps (K=15,25,35; N=25,50,100,200)

**📊 Visual:** Use `experimental_design_diagram.png`
