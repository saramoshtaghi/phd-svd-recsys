Children's / Horror — Venn calculations
------------------------------------------------------------
#books in Children's = 863
#books in Horror = 769
#both (Children's ∩ Horror) = 12
only Children's = 863 - 12 = 851
only Horror = 769 - 12 = 757
union (Children's ∪ Horror) = 851 + 757 + 12 = 1620
union (from log) = 1620  [OK]
negative pool (outside union) = 7795
