Horror / Science Fiction — Venn calculations
------------------------------------------------------------
#books in Horror = 769
#books in Science Fiction = 855
#both (Horror ∩ Science Fiction) = 46
only Horror = 769 - 46 = 723
only Science Fiction = 855 - 46 = 809
union (Horror ∪ Science Fiction) = 723 + 809 + 46 = 1578
union (from log) = 1578  [OK]
negative pool (outside union) = 7837
