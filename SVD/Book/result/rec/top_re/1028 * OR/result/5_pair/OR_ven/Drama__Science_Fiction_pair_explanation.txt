Drama / Science Fiction — Venn calculations
------------------------------------------------------------
#books in Drama = 3006
#books in Science Fiction = 855
#both (Drama ∩ Science Fiction) = 65
only Drama = 3006 - 65 = 2941
only Science Fiction = 855 - 65 = 790
union (Drama ∪ Science Fiction) = 2941 + 790 + 65 = 3796
union (from log) = 3796  [OK]
negative pool (outside union) = 5619
