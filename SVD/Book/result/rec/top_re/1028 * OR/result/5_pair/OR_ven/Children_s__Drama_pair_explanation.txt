Children's / Drama — Venn calculations
------------------------------------------------------------
#books in Children's = 863
#books in Drama = 3006
#both (Children's ∩ Drama) = 94
only Children's = 863 - 94 = 769
only Drama = 3006 - 94 = 2912
union (Children's ∪ Drama) = 769 + 2912 + 94 = 3775
union (from log) = 3775  [OK]
negative pool (outside union) = 5640
