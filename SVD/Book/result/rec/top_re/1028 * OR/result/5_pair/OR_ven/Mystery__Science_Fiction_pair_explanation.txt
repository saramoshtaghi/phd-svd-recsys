Mystery / Science Fiction — Venn calculations
------------------------------------------------------------
#books in Mystery = 2563
#books in Science Fiction = 855
#both (Mystery ∩ Science Fiction) = 130
only Mystery = 2563 - 130 = 2433
only Science Fiction = 855 - 130 = 725
union (Mystery ∪ Science Fiction) = 2433 + 725 + 130 = 3288
union (from log) = 3288  [OK]
negative pool (outside union) = 6127
