Children's / Thriller — Venn calculations
------------------------------------------------------------
#books in Children's = 863
#books in Thriller = 1606
#both (Children's ∩ Thriller) = 0
only Children's = 863 - 0 = 863
only Thriller = 1606 - 0 = 1606
union (Children's ∪ Thriller) = 863 + 1606 + 0 = 2469
union (from log) = 2469  [OK]
negative pool (outside union) = 6946
