Adult / Children's — Venn calculations
------------------------------------------------------------
#books in Adult = 331
#books in Children's = 863
#both (Adult ∩ Children's) = 0
only Adult = 331 - 0 = 331
only Children's = 863 - 0 = 863
union (Adult ∪ Children's) = 331 + 863 + 0 = 1194
union (from log) = 1194  [OK]
negative pool (outside union) = 8221
