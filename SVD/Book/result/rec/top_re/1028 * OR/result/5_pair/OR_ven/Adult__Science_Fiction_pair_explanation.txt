Adult / Science Fiction — Venn calculations
------------------------------------------------------------
#books in Adult = 331
#books in Science Fiction = 855
#both (Adult ∩ Science Fiction) = 0
only Adult = 331 - 0 = 331
only Science Fiction = 855 - 0 = 855
union (Adult ∪ Science Fiction) = 331 + 855 + 0 = 1186
union (from log) = 1186  [OK]
negative pool (outside union) = 8229
