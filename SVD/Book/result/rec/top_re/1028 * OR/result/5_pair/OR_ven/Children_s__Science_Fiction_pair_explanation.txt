Children's / Science Fiction — Venn calculations
------------------------------------------------------------
#books in Children's = 863
#books in Science Fiction = 855
#both (Children's ∩ Science Fiction) = 12
only Children's = 863 - 12 = 851
only Science Fiction = 855 - 12 = 843
union (Children's ∪ Science Fiction) = 851 + 843 + 12 = 1706
union (from log) = 1706  [OK]
negative pool (outside union) = 7709
