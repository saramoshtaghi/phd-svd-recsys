Children's / Mystery — Venn calculations
------------------------------------------------------------
#books in Children's = 863
#books in Mystery = 2563
#both (Children's ∩ Mystery) = 67
only Children's = 863 - 67 = 796
only Mystery = 2563 - 67 = 2496
union (Children's ∪ Mystery) = 796 + 2496 + 67 = 3359
union (from log) = 3359  [OK]
negative pool (outside union) = 6056
